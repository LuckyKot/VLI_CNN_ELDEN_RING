A simple CNN model that recognizes location from a game ELDEN RING by a screenshot.
Currently has 7 locations:  
'Caelid', 'Crumbling Farum Azula', 'Leyndell, Capital of Ash', 'Limgrave', 'Liurnia', 'Mountain of the Giants', 'Round Table Hold'.

Simple sequential CNN with ADAM optimizer.

The data was gathered by me. I recorded a video footage of an in-game character moving around these locations and then split these videos into screenshots with opencv script. Split the data into categories via folders.
